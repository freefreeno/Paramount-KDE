## Paramount-KDE

Complete dark KDE Plasma theme that looks best when used with the force blur script. Includes Plasma theme, two color schemes, two aurorae themes and two GTK themes. Built to be used with force blur. Force blur can be found here:https://store.kde.org/p/1294604

I also may make a look and feel theme for this but it really kinda of depends on how popular it is.

A good tutorial on using force blur is at the KDE wiki here:https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Force_Transparency_And_Blur I had previously stayed away from making all my apps transaparent because I thought it must have a very negative impact on performance but it doesn't really hurt it that bad so I highly recommend checking it out and once you have it enabled then try this theme or the other the way around.

The Newaita icons look great with theme and they are here:https://store.kde.org/p/1243493 & https://github.com/cbrnix/Newaita

## I used the sweet aurorae theme to make the window decorations:
